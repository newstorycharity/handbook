# Tech Team
This team was built through much searching and deliberation. Members will come and go over time, but their contribution is no less important. Beyond merely making an appearance in the [contributor log](https://github.com/newstorycharity/newstory/graphs/contributors) on Github, this section adds color and a heartbeat to the team members behind the software.

This isn't about titles ([you can find those here](https://newstorycharity.org/team/)). It's about the people that helped shape technology at New Story.

_P.S. Feel free to maintain your own profile. It's part of your legacy at New Story._

## Morgan J Lopes
**(2016-present)**  
### Why New Story?
The most fulfilling work in life is that which is done in service to others. New Story continues to present the greatest opportunity for intentional, lasting impact for the largest percentage of those in need around the world.

### What excites you most about our vision?
Achieving it will require me and everyone involved to learn, grow, and stretch more than we even thought possible. The notion the a life lived in service to others will yield the greatest version of ourselves is a beautiful paradox that I'm excited to continue exploring.

### Who has had the greated impacted your career in technology? Why?
_Jason Ardell._ His investment of time, energy, and encouragement is a debt I could never repay. Beyond teaching me how to think like an engineer, the leadership he modeled has impacted my life, my family, the teams I've helped build, those at New Story, and far beyond. His request has been simple, 'go and do likewise'.

_John Rae._ One of the first few hires at [Polar Notion](https://polarnotion.com), John's tenacity and adaptability highlighted a chance for my work to mean more than just the software I wrote. Helping him become a software engineer reframed my efforts as a professional and challenged me to emulate the example that Jason shared by both teaching others and challenging them to do likewise.

### What would you say to our next hire?
The [Welcome Letter](/welcome.md) was written for you, start there.

Congratulations! Purpose filled work is a gift. Enjoy.

We move quickly here because the work matters. Keep up. Every day, thousands of people are born into the population of 1.3 billion without proper housing. Each day, thousands die within that population from the abysmal conditions of survival mode. When the work seems tiresome, remember that it's not for you. It's for them.

That being said, you'll have unbelieveable experiences here with remarkable people. Working alongside so many high-performing, passion team members will challenge and inspire you. When it does, tell someone. The energy, excitement, and support is a neccessary part of doing this work.

Lastly, push yourself. Our massive vision will require more from you than you can even imagine. You'll be expected to learn, grow, and challenge the status quo. Own your experience and dream bigger.

Godspeed,  
Morgan J Lopes
