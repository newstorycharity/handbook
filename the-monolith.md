# The Monolith
In the early days of New Story, information was spread across many systems. Donations were processed through many services, family data was tracted in Excel, and donor information was fragmented, siloed, and disconnected. We'll refer to that as Version 1.

Today, we have the Monolith. Time will tell how [majestic](https://m.signalvnoise.com/the-majestic-monolith-29166d022228) it truly is, but it provides a single source of truth for the flow of information through New Story. The most distinguishing charecteristic is our ability to track a single donor to the specific home it helped build. Within that home, we can view the family and it's individual recipients. For each recipient, we also have the survey data that's been collected.

Eventually this level of visibility into philanthropy and global aid will be common place. Today, it solves a major painpoint. And while the Monolith will eventually we replaced with 'the next thing', the purpose should always be advancing: increased transparency and increased impact.

The Monolith is a tool. Like all good tools it should be well maintained, sharpened, and replaced before it breaks.

_**Treat it with care and I trust it'll return the favor.**_
