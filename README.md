# New Story Tech Handbook
#### Ending survival mode with engineered solutions, operational efficiency, and powerful tools for New Story and our collective of partners.

[Welcome to the tech team.]

Our work and the way in which we do it goes hand in hand. It's secondary however, to the families we serve. Men, women, and children... there are over a billion people living in survival mode. Statistically, you'll never meet any of them.* However, we are working diligently towards a future in which their lives are forever changed.

This handbook outlines core processes and systems. Read it, reference it, and do not hesistate to issue a pull request when it needs to be changed.

[//]: # (If you're reading this, welcome behind the veil. Since I started in 2016, New Story's team and vision has seen tremendous growth. The future looks brighter today than ever. The only way that continues to be true is when passion filled, embolded people step up and focus on the work that matters most. If we have lost our way, congratulations! I nominate you to lead us back. - Godspeed, @morganjlopes (2018)
