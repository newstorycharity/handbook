# The Housing Innovation Toolkit (HIT)
_**At New Story, we pioneer solutions to end global homelessness.**_

After buiding custom software for our own team, we've seen just how much more impactful a team becomes when equipped with solutions. We've realized that the biggest impact we can have is not to become the biggest organization in our sector or to build the most houses. It's to empower the entire sector with our learnings.

Enter the Housing Innovation Toolkit. We have begun to democratize our solutions and processes, making them available to other organizations so that we can work together and collectively solve the problem.

While the HIT includes other assets, our team is focused on software tools. We've started with rebuilding the Survey tools that we tested in the Monolith, incorporating some of our learnings. Over time, the entire Monolith will be replaced and the New Story team will move to the new tools in a phased approach. In the meantime, we will be onboarding other organizations to each tool.
