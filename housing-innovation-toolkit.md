# The Housing Innovation Toolkit (HIT)
_**At New Story, we pioneer solutions to end global homelessness.**_

After buiding custom software for our own team, we've seen just how much more impactful an organization becomes when equipped with the right solutions. We've realized that the biggest impact we can have is not to become the biggest organization in our sector, compete with other organizations, or to build the most houses. The best way to tackle this monumental problem is to empower the entire sector with our learnings.

Enter the Housing Innovation Toolkit. We have begun to democratize our solutions and processes, making them available to other organizations so that we can work together and collectively solve the problem.

While the HIT includes other digital and physical assets, the Tech team is focused on software tools. We've started with rebuilding the Survey tools that we tested in the Monolith, incorporating our learnings from using the existing tool in the field.

Over time, the entire Monolith will be replaced and the New Story team will move to the new tools in a phased approach. In the meantime, we will be onboarding our partners to each tool as it makes sense for their organization.
