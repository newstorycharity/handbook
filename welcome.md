# Welcome
You are not here out of need, you are here by choice. There are other places you could have worked and other talented people we could have hired. You were chosen on purpose. You have permission to own your experience and your impact on the world.

Welcome to the Tech Team at New Story. We’re on a mission to engineer solutions, increase operational efficiency, and build powerful tools to end survival mode. The work matters and our attitude will drive the final outcome. More than rules, the following behaviors reflect a physical manifestation of our ethos as the tech team.

People like us do things like this…
  
 - [We solve problems.]
 - [We ask questions.]
 - [We balance tradeoffs.]
 - [We educate others.]
 - [We exist to serve.]


## We solve problems.
With 1.3 billion people living in survival mode, we combine form and function to solve real problems felt by real people. No problem is too great when the stakes are so high.
  
Rather than focusing on the scale of the problem, we entertain all viable solutions. When we look at the problem, it’s to increase our understanding and empathize with those effected. Our commitment to those in need is an expression of our own gratitude.
  
_**We are solution oriented.**_


## We ask questions.
Seeking to fully understand the problems we solve, we inquire constantly to gain insight, receive feedback, and build the right products for those we serve. Our own opinions yield to data driven insights.

Points are not awarded for validating our own beliefs. We constantly seek more input to better understand and skillfully act.

_**We are truth seekers.**_


## We balance tradeoffs.
Weighing conflicting constraints, we find or create the right solution for the given problem. We discern the difference between problems to be solved and tensions to be managed, then treat each appropriately.

There are no perfect decisions. Refusing to be immobilized by that truth, we accept good decisions today vs great decisions tomorrow.

_**We are thoughtful risk takers.**_


## We educate others.
Protecting our team’s time, we intentionally introduce them to a deeper understanding of the resources at their disposal. It’s not their job to know, it’s our responsibility to teach them and advocate for their continued growth.

As technology continues to evolve, our ability to teach is linked to our willingness to expand our knowledge. Rather than waiting for it to find us, we seek more knowledge.

_**We are lifetime learners.**_


## We exist to serve.
Submitting to a greater purpose, our team exists to serve others. Technology is a tool, but humans remain the catalyst for true impact. We prepare the space for them to thrive.

Regardless of what the market may say, our knowledge and understanding exist to increase the effectiveness of others, not maximize our own endeavors. Achieving extraordinary results is a team effort. 

_**We are servants.**_

---------------------

## Where to go from here.

The journey ahead belongs to you even more than those who came before you. Convinced that our greatest work lies ahead, your role is more precious than we even realize. The future will require more of us all than we currently think possible.

We are eager to help you through this transition as we continue to pursue this vision together.

_**Godspeed.**_
